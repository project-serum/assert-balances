# Assert Balances

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/project-serum/assert-balances.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/project-serum/assert-balances)

Assert Balances can be used as an additional safety check by wallets and other apps
to ensure the outcome of a given transaction is as expected. One can
insert into the end of a transaction an instruction that calls this program,
asserting that balances are greater than or equal to some expected amount. If a
transaction ends up changing balances more than expected, it will abort.
